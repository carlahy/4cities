\section{Urban engineering and fin-de-si√®cle urbanism}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textit{The beginning of `serious' planning. Technical and engineering challenges are emerging in growing cities (mid to late 19th century), and this period is focusing on massive infrastructure to make cities safe and enable their expansion. The goal is to avoid health crises (eg. cholera) or natural disasters (eg. flooding). It is about averting risk, adaptation planning, and laying the technical foundations which enabled later social and political phases (eg. Red Vienna).}

\bisection{Building codes} new building codes to regulate height of buildings and minimum street width (which improves airflow and hygiene)

\bisection{Grid pattern} originating from NYC and became a planning norm

\bisection{Urban engineering elements} technical infrastructure elements height zoning, outer suburbs incorporated, trees planted along boulevards, gas lights in streets, electricity and electric street cars, bridges for metropolitan railroad, granite pavements, new sewers

\bisection{Urban design elements}\alignedmarginpar{Ringstrasse} beautification accompanies urban engineering through parks, green belts, cultural and educational institutions, tenement palaces, world exhibition (serve to spread ideas), urban furniture. Some works like public hospitals can fall in both engineering and beautification categories

\bisection{Tenement housing} luxury tenement palaces open, built in different styles (neo-gothic, neo-baroque, neo-renaissance)

\bisection{Transporting ideas, patents, technologies}\alignedmarginpar{corrugated iron} world exhibitions are mega-events which drive innovation by spreading ideas across countries/continents. Starchitects recycle ancient architectural styles to beautify cities\alignedmarginpar{Athens in Vienna}

\section{Reformist urbanism pre-WWII}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textit{Cities are growing and need some organisation and order, and a reconfiguration of places and borders, to respond to the ills of the industrial city and urbanisation. This period is the origin of social welfare and democracy, when there are qualitative improvements in education (schools), health system (hospitals), social work (orphenages, social housing, public pools, libraries). Nonetheless previous elements of planning, like engineering (pipelines, electricity, sewers) are still around.}

\bisection{Tool} zoning

\bisection{New towns and garden cities}\alignedmarginpar{Lechtsworth, 1903; Le Corbusier Villes Radieuses} starting in the early 1900s as a solution to mass housing; follow the principles of separating uses and homesteading, where there is healthy living and working; emerge as `new towns' in the UK; the idea internationalises through conferences, spreading through Europe, North Am., Russia, etc.

\bisection{Settlers' movement}\alignedmarginpar{Otto Wagner hospital vs. allotment gardens vs. garden city}people are given land to grow food during the war as a subsistence wartime economy; after WWI, these allotment gardens are turned into cooperative, grassroots movement creating spontaneous unplanned suburbs, contrast to garden cities 

\bisection{Social housing} during WWI investments in housing stopped, hyperinflation destroyed loans, rapid rent increase because of unregulated rental market, war industry affect industrial and rural areas; social housing emerged from socialist states as way to regulate housing market. Introduced rent freeze and social housing, an upgrade from tenement housing - has more green space, inner courtyard, kindergarten

\bisection{Zoning} previously only focusing on height regulation of buildings (19th century) but allowed almost all land use types. Early 1900s introduced green belts, industrial zones, in a concentric model, disallowed mixed uses. In 1930s, first high-rises arrive in Europe

\bisection{Regional planning}\alignedmarginpar{conurbation} resistance to incorporation of more and more land by cities into `greater' cities (19th century) creates a need for regional planning because urban regions need coordination for transport systems, recreation areas. Happening at a similar time than suburbanisation, and creates urban cores (where people work) and commuter zones (where people live). Settlement looks continuous, and no visible rural area per se

\section{Modernist urbanism post-WWII}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textit{The emergence of welfare states after 1945 means that the concepts from the inter-war reformist period has superseeded. Planning is reconstructed in parallel to the new democratic times, and infused by economic and social policies}

\bisection{Garden cities} The idea expanded after 1945 into New Towns. Cities had to be reconstructed, and debate emerged on housing density - should housing be high-rise (requiring significantly less land, more dense) or low-rise (housing spills into outer rural areas, less dense). The city should be build and ordered by its function

\bisection{Social housing} Golden age of social housing, with a mass production of social housing improving in quality (eg. size, bathroom, heating). Public housing was the biggest share of the housing supplies in some countries. State offered subsidies for building housing and housing morgages. Rent liberalisation phased out affordable housing

\bisection{Zoning} Continued, improved, and extended to the whole urban area. Includes land-use regulations, careful planning of what uses should be allowed next to each other, and mixed-zoning is over

\bisection{Regional planning} Continued resistance to incorporation especially in new democratic times, as such regional planning remains rare and difficult. But it is needed, so regions find other ways such as coordinating cycling paths, public transport systems with uniform tarrif system, planning recreational and protected areas, etc

\bisection{Urban social policy} In 19th century, there were limited social policies, only insurances for the elite. In 20th century, in the inter-war period, pioneering systems start providing social health, education, housing. Social policies popularise post-1945 with a new type of welfare system under capitalism, impinging on planning

\bisection{Urban economic policy} In the 19th century, urban economic policies are non-existant and investors are free to do what they want. In 1920s, private supply of elementary infrastructure is questionned as inefficient, unreliable, expensive. Post-1945, State focuses on building heavy industry (public gas, metal), until 1970s when States start attracting investors and international political institutions through locationalised policies\alignedmarginpar{UN City Vienna}

\bisection{Welfare and housing regimes} Nation States become ambitious and create many welfare policies, including housing, education, health. Different regimes organise their welfare systems differently\alignedmarginpar{Welfare triangle}. Liberal regime centered on the market; social democratic regime centered around state supply; conservative regime centered aroundfamily supply and informal connections. In housing sectors, unitary vs. dualist regimes where public and private markets influence each other to various degrees

\bisection{Stages of urban development} Dynamics of urban/suburban/desuburban/deurban-isation change population of core and ring zones, and are dynamics to be tamed and managed with planning

\bisection{Socialist and post-socialist urbanism} Political systems such as communism impact urban development, with socialist cities having different characteristics and urban dynamics.
