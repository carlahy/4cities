\section{Planning the medieval city}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\bisection{From roman empire to middle ages} the Dark Ages (500-1000AD) was a period during which many former powers disappeared - the Roman empire disintegrated which cut off trade routes and information flows (except for oriental merchants), technologies were lost, cities shrank and disappeared. Then started the Middle Ages

\bisection{Early middle ages} the Ancient world was fragmented into small-scale, manorial feudalist places, protected by fortifications and (medieval) castles\alignedmarginpar{Tower of London, Ljubljana castle}. The manor was an economic, judicial, military unit

\bisection{High middle ages} cities in this period have 6 origins:
1) former Roman cities blossoming anew, as residences of Emperors, Archbishops, Dukes (Aachen, Cologne, Vienna)
2) monastery settlements
3) castles of the Principality (``bourg'') combined with settlements for craftsmen and merchants (``faubourg'', Graz, Ljubljana)
4) commercial settlements of free merchants and craftsmen
5) free manors and market-towns
6) newly-founded mining towns

\bisection{Characteristics of medieval cities} city walls to protect against barbaric attacks, and castle on a hill; ditches around the city (`graben'); narrow streets with burger houses; church (christian endeavour); central market square to feed a growing population. Almost all European cities date from the high High Middle Ages

\bisection{High medieval city} 1200AD, new towns founded, ancient towns renewed; strict separation of urban and rural functions, with two types of urban places - natural settlements as local-market based central places, and systemic settlements as long-distance-trade based, with varying degrees of freedom from feudal powers. Flanders and North Italy are two hearths of Medieval urbanism. They are `trade-originating' Europe and systematic settlements, compared to the rest as `trade-supporting' Europe with natural settlements that depend on their role as central places. Black death pandemics (1348) more than halve populations of cities

\bisection{Urbanism in High Medieval Cities} unlike Ancient cities, housing combines work and home because space is scarse; built with local building materials and with vernacular architecture; ancient infrastructure like amphitheatres are recycled into new uses or their material reused. Two basic types of cities are the Mediterranean (an uninterrupted urban tradition) and the North of the Alps (new foundations and many new settlers)

\bisection{Mediterranean city} a city of factions, building upon and with Roman remains; house-towers, mix of Renaissance palaces, earliest tenement houses, and individual houses, many arcades

\bisection{North of the Alps} a city of guilds, there are no city-states bordering each other, but Free Cities surrounded by feudal countryside, stark contrast between urban-rural society. Two settlement systems are ``central-place'' and ``mercantile'', there's a functional segregation based on guilds. Merchants are clustering at ports, nobilty remaining in countryside castles. There are tall house-shops, narrow plots, tight city walls, apprenticeships and journeymen, and ``quarters of tolerance'' for the outsider merchants or students

\bisection{Timeline of Medieval Cities} from geomorphic and unplanned evolving into a geometric planned city: unplanned cities (1100) $\rightarrow$ rebirth of the planned city $\rightarrow$ cross-shaped market towns $\rightarrow$ towns with long market-streets $\rightarrow$ towns with ladder-type streets $\rightarrow$ rebirth of the grid city $\rightarrow$ the grid-shaped town (13th century)

\section{Urban engineering and fin-de-si√®cle urbanism}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textit{The beginning of `serious' planning. Technical and engineering challenges are emerging in growing cities (mid to late 19th century), and this period is focusing on massive infrastructure to make cities safe and enable their expansion. The goal is to avoid health crises (eg. cholera) or natural disasters (eg. flooding). It is about averting risk, adaptation planning, and laying the technical foundations which enabled later social and political phases (eg. Red Vienna).}

\bisection{Building codes} new building codes to regulate height of buildings and minimum street width (which improves airflow and hygiene)

\bisection{Grid pattern} originating from NYC and became a planning norm

\bisection{Urban engineering elements} technical infrastructure elements height zoning, outer suburbs incorporated, trees planted along boulevards, gas lights in streets, electricity and electric street cars, bridges for metropolitan railroad, granite pavements, new sewers

\bisection{Urban design elements}\alignedmarginpar{Ringstrasse} beautification accompanies urban engineering through parks, green belts, cultural and educational institutions, tenement palaces, world exhibition (serve to spread ideas), urban furniture. Some works like public hospitals can fall in both engineering and beautification categories

\bisection{Tenement housing} luxury tenement palaces open, built in different styles (neo-gothic, neo-baroque, neo-renaissance)

\bisection{Transporting ideas, patents, technologies}\alignedmarginpar{corrugated iron} world exhibitions are mega-events which drive innovation by spreading ideas across countries/continents. Starchitects recycle ancient architectural styles to beautify cities\alignedmarginpar{Athens in Vienna}

\section{Reformist urbanism pre-WWII}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textit{Cities are growing and need some organisation and order, and a reconfiguration of places and borders, to respond to the ills of the industrial city and urbanisation. This period is the origin of social welfare and democracy, when there are qualitative improvements in education (schools), health system (hospitals), social work (orphenages, social housing, public pools, libraries). Nonetheless previous elements of planning, like engineering (pipelines, electricity, sewers) are still around.}

\bisection{Tool} zoning

\bisection{New towns and garden cities}\alignedmarginpar{Lechtsworth, 1903; Le Corbusier Villes Radieuses} starting in the early 1900s as a solution to mass housing; follow the principles of separating uses and homesteading, where there is healthy living and working; emerge as `new towns' in the UK; the idea internationalises through conferences, spreading through Europe, North Am., Russia, etc.

\bisection{Settlers' movement}\alignedmarginpar{Otto Wagner hospital vs. allotment gardens vs. garden city}people are given land to grow food during the war as a subsistence wartime economy; after WWI, these allotment gardens are turned into cooperative, grassroots movement creating spontaneous unplanned suburbs, contrast to garden cities 

\bisection{Social housing} during WWI investments in housing stopped, hyperinflation destroyed loans, rapid rent increase because of unregulated rental market, war industry affect industrial and rural areas; social housing emerged from socialist states as way to regulate housing market. Introduced rent freeze and social housing, an upgrade from tenement housing - has more green space, inner courtyard, kindergarten

\bisection{Zoning} previously only focusing on height regulation of buildings (19th century) but allowed almost all land use types. Early 1900s introduced green belts, industrial zones, in a concentric model, disallowed mixed uses. In 1930s, first high-rises arrive in Europe

\bisection{Regional planning}\alignedmarginpar{conurbation} resistance to incorporation of more and more land by cities into `greater' cities (19th century) creates a need for regional planning because urban regions need coordination for transport systems, recreation areas. Happening at a similar time than suburbanisation, and creates urban cores (where people work) and commuter zones (where people live). Settlement looks continuous, and no visible rural area per se

\section{Modernist urbanism post-WWII}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textit{The emergence of welfare states after 1945 means that the concepts from the inter-war reformist period has superseeded. Planning is reconstructed in parallel to the new democratic times, and infused by economic and social policies}

\bisection{Garden cities} The idea expanded after 1945 into New Towns. Cities had to be reconstructed, and debate emerged on housing density - should housing be high-rise (requiring significantly less land, more dense) or low-rise (housing spills into outer rural areas, less dense). The city should be build and ordered by its function

\bisection{Social housing} Golden age of social housing, with a mass production of social housing improving in quality (eg. size, bathroom, heating). Public housing was the biggest share of the housing supplies in some countries. State offered subsidies for building housing and housing morgages. Rent liberalisation phased out affordable housing

\bisection{Zoning} Continued, improved, and extended to the whole urban area. Includes land-use regulations, careful planning of what uses should be allowed next to each other, and mixed-zoning is over

\bisection{Regional planning} Continued resistance to incorporation especially in new democratic times, as such regional planning remains rare and difficult. But it is needed, so regions find other ways such as coordinating cycling paths, public transport systems with uniform tarrif system, planning recreational and protected areas, etc

\bisection{Urban social policy} In 19th century, there were limited social policies, only insurances for the elite. In 20th century, in the inter-war period, pioneering systems start providing social health, education, housing. Social policies popularise post-1945 with a new type of welfare system under capitalism, impinging on planning

\bisection{Urban economic policy} In the 19th century, urban economic policies are non-existant and investors are free to do what they want. In 1920s, private supply of elementary infrastructure is questionned as inefficient, unreliable, expensive. Post-1945, State focuses on building heavy industry (public gas, metal), until 1970s when States start attracting investors and international political institutions through locationalised policies\alignedmarginpar{UN City Vienna}

\bisection{Welfare and housing regimes} Nation States become ambitious and create many welfare policies, including housing, education, health. Different regimes organise their welfare systems differently\alignedmarginpar{Welfare triangle}. Liberal regime centered on the market; social democratic regime centered around state supply; conservative regime centered aroundfamily supply and informal connections. In housing sectors, unitary vs. dualist regimes where public and private markets influence each other to various degrees

\bisection{Stages of urban development} Dynamics of urban/suburban/desuburban/deurban-isation change population of core and ring zones, and are dynamics to be tamed and managed with planning

\bisection{Socialist and post-socialist urbanism} Political systems such as communism impact urban development, with socialist cities having different characteristics and urban dynamics.
