\begin{outline}
	\1 Quantitative work analysing 35 studies and looking at the health, wellbeing, social and physical activity outcomes of blue spaces, and environmental impacts 
	\1 Presence of green spaces in urban environments improves people's health, and reduces air and noise pollution. Blue space has an impact on people by proximity (touching, being in or near water) and distally/virtually (seeing, hearing, smelling, sensing water)
	\1 Less is known about the quantitative which can answer questions like ``is living near or having better access to blue space environments associated with positive health and well-being outcomes?'' (p. 1212). This paper provides a systematic review of blue space and morbidity, using available quantitative data
	\1 Do the positives seen with green spaces, like better health and reduced pollution, apply to blue spaces?
	\1 p. 1215: Assessment of exposure to blue space: took into account outdoor blue space type (inland or non-inland), the environment assessed (residential, school, leisure...)
		\2 Inland blue spaces: rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, rivulets, wetlands, freshwaters
