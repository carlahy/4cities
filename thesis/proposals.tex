\subsection{Veganism: how does this cultural, environmental and ethical movement shape the city?}

\textit{Keywords: veganism, lifestyle, gentrification, ??? culture ???}

Veganism is a movement that has gained popularity in the last decade or so. People adhere to it for a variety of reasons: environmental (animal products have a significant impact on the environment compared to plant-based products), ethical (the belief that humans do not have the right to consume animals simply because they can), health (plant-based diets have health merits), cultural (it is a lifestyle, can be spiritual and align with religious beliefs, and create community). 

Although a personal choice, the vegan `trend' has wider consequences. With the rise in popularity came new products, businesses, and restaurants selling plant-based alternatives which can be expensive. Vegan shops and restaurants are often associated with hipster, trendy neighbourhoods. 
What is particularly interesting is that the movement comes from positive intentions - to reduce one's impact on the environment and animal cruelty - but is criticised as a middle-class lifestyle unaffordable to many, is accused of eroding cultural heritage and traditions, and ???. Given that veganism is spreading across cities in the global North, I want to explore its impact on cities.

I could approach this from the perspective of ???

What would also be interesting is looking at two different European cities, for example Copenhagen and Madrid.
