\section{Exercise I}

Checkout the statistical figures and maps of your neighbourhood with your group on monitoringdesquartiers.brussels. Discuss the demographic profile of your neighbourhood, for example housing, ethnic composition, age structure, educational or employment level, etc. What is particularly striking about your neighbourhood? Amongst the various documents gathered for the portfolio, select one figure that demonstrates the particularity of your neighbourhood. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Think about how to represent this figure
	\item How would you explain what you see in the figure?
	\item think about locating the neighbourhood's social characteristics across space (within the city) and across time
\end{itemize}

Question to answer: Did social characteristics of the neighbourhood change over time? How do the characteristics of the neighbourhood differ from other neighbourhoods in Brussels?
