\pagebreak\section{Urban Geographical Traditions}

\textbf{Globalised urbanisation}: urbanisation is a global phenomenon. It is also unequal across the world (eg. Asia dominates economic growth and urbanisation). The `urban age' frame can be criticised:\alignedmarginpar{Brenner and Schmid, 2014} measurements depend on diverging national definitions, and it is a chaotic abstraction that does not neatly overlay cities in a spatial sense.\alignedmarginpar{Urban vs. Rural}

\textbf{The urban}: a distinctive way of life, which can take place in the city but also outside (suburbs, rural, slums). It epitomises a particular society (capitalist, industrial, fordist, modern, classist, etc.). It projects symbolic power, notably by means of its built environment.

\textbf{The city}: the material built environment. Has a complex division of labour, with increasing efficiency and surplus, but also inequalities. It projects symbolic power\alignedmarginpar{Skyscrapers (Dubai, NYC); CCTV tower (Beijing)}, and has physical and administrative boundaries. The `non-city' is hard to define, because it's hard to know where the city ends: the `rural', the peripheries, can have elements of the city.

\textbf{Urbanisation}: the process of becoming urban. It is a demographic process, whereby cities gain more and varied residents, with increasing density. It entails a globalisation of urban economic, political and cultural influence. It considers how space is organised through processes of uneven development.

\textbf{Geography}: the social and physical processes within the context of space. There are multiple concepts of space: \textbf{territory}, the boundaries and sovereignty of a space\alignedmarginpar{Brussels capital}; \textbf{scale}, the sensitivity of processes; \textbf{network}, hubs and leaks beyond the territory, towards micro-networks; and \textbf{place}, the attachement of meaning and sentiment to a space.

\textbf{Critical geography}:\alignedmarginpar{Jonas et al., Sayer, Brenner and Schmid} epistemological rules of thumb include: acknowledging that there is no universal theory of anything; knowing every theory has birthmarks, ie. is situated in time and space, and reflecting on the birthmarks is necessary to be critical\alignedmarginpar{provincialisation}; asking whether theories can be used across contexts; engaging in pluralism to allow inter-theoretical conversation and comparison.

\textbf{Materialist approaches to geography}: concerned with the distribution and social-justice, and agenda-setting.

\textbf{Humanist approaches to geography}: about the experienced city, issues of representation and discourse, uses qualitative methods, gives a voice.

\pagebreak\section{Theories of World-City Formation}

\textbf{Measuring centrality of cities/city-regions}:\alignedmarginpar{Deltametropolis, Flemish Diamond, RheinRuhr, Ile-de-France, Greater London}there are multiple ways to measure the power of cities or regions, like the weight of the area in the national context (regarding GRP, density...), the number of patents, the level of education, the proportion of employment per sector (higher in the service sector than industry or agriculture).

\textbf{World cities}:\alignedmarginpar{Friedmann}world cities are points of functional centrality, serving command and control functions in a global urban system, where processes cross national borders. The world economy is restructured, there is a new international division of labour (offshoring), TNCs and MNCs dominate the global supply chain that is highly integrated.
This creates uneven socio, economic and spatial developments because of a hierarchy connecting the core (absorbing the surplus) and the periphery.

\textbf{Global cities}:\alignedmarginpar{Sassen}path dependencies concentrate Advanced Producer Services in select cities. The path dependencies include the extensive services market providing access for firm/client relations, the labour market and associated culture, the APS complex and the cross-border connections offered by its network. 
APS have control capabilities and \textbf{polarise the labour market} (high and low-skilled labour required). This results in the \textbf{peripheralisation} of the core.

\textbf{Global city regions}:\alignedmarginpar{Scott\\Silicon Valley, Pearl River Delta}a complex assemble of cities, settlements, hinterlands that are interconnected by production networks, themselves oriented towards the global economy. An urban core is not always required for a region to be central in the post-Fordist industry (ie. service and knowledge industries). APS can still be an indicator for global city regions.

\textbf{GaWC heuristic}: used to map the world-city network. Assumption is that the presence of international APS firms can be used to indicate the presence of command-and-control functions of cities.

\textbf{Post-colonial critique}:\alignedmarginpar{Robinson} the western bias in urban knowledge production leaves places off the map of urban studies. Off the geographical map (global South), and off the conceptual map (limited economic processes, ignores inter-urban connections). World cities research ignores `ordinary' cities in the global economy.

\textbf{Social-constructivist critique}:\alignedmarginpar{Massey}the world-cities are politically constructed, and their consequences are un-debated and hide other realities\alignedmarginpar{London's financial centre vs. low-skilled labour}. World cities are not a given but a product of local and global forces, mediated by acts of representation (financial and political elites, or policies that promote the city).

\textbf{Political-economy critique}:\alignedmarginpar{Brenner}there is a rescaling of the state due to globalisation, which changes the political and economic scales to supra and sub-national levels. There are new governance structures, a shift from managerialism to entrepreneurialism\alignedmarginpar{inter-urban competition}, global accumulation regimes are centred on (global) cities, their importance reinforced by global city building agendas.

\textbf{Financialisation critique}:\alignedmarginpar{Bassens \& van Meeteren}the deregulation of financial markets has financialised firms who are mostly present in APS complexes. Unfortunately this leads to global financial crises, and tax evasions.

\pagebreak\section{Polarisation in World/Global Cities}

\textbf{Polarisation}:\alignedmarginpar{Friedmann and Wolf, citadel vs. ghetto}a class division that is reproduced through space, and is stronger in global cities. Polarisation is explained by an \textbf{economic restructuring}\alignedmarginpar{North-Atlantic}. Productivity has increased, but wages have not because profit is invested elsewhere (eg. financialisation)

\textbf{Economic restructuring}: post-Fordism restructured the economy. Production was relocated (globalisation, NIDL); deindustrialisation declined activity in the city; structural unemployment; shift towards fiscal austerity\alignedmarginpar{declining tax base}; market rationality and privatisation\alignedmarginpar{neoliberalism}; shift from state to market control over multinational capital; inter-urban competition.

\textbf{Harvey's entrepreneurial strategies}: \textbf{Production}: policy makers create/exploit certain advantages for the production of goods and services; forms clusters and edge cities. \textbf{Consumption}: improving the city's position in the spatial division of consumption; affects socio-spatial structure. \textbf{Redistribution}: competition for (supra)nationally redistributed surplus from the economy. \textbf{Command and control}: investing in high finance, government, and information economy; forms monopoly spaces in global/world cities.

\textbf{Polarisation thesis}:\alignedmarginpar{Friedmann \& Wolff; Sassen}the change in economic base led to a decline of well-paid manufacturing job (exodus) and a growth in service jobs (formal \& informal) with an influx of high-salaried workers (professional and managerial jobs) and low-skilled workers to support their lifestyle and routine service jobs. Creates an ``hourglass'' of ``upper circuit''/``underclass''.\alignedmarginpar{urban elite networks}

\textbf{Labour market globalisation}: global cities have high-paid and low-paid migrants, often divided ethnically.\alignedmarginpar{expat vs. immigrant} Growing supply of low-skilled migrant labour for typically 3D jobs (dirty, demanding/difficult, dangerous) drives wages down. There is growing informality and a \textbf{``peripheralisation at the core''}\alignedmarginpar{Sassen-Koob}, where exploitation not only takes place in the global South but also global North where the `peripheralised' live. \textbf{New forms of industrial exploitation} in \alignedmarginpar{sweatshops}global cities are made possible by the absence of regulation in the (global) periphery.

\textbf{Criticism of polarisation in global cities}: universalising and generalising tendencies, but does the logic apply elsewhere than NY-LON-TOK? Simplistic theory that reduces complexity of occupational and spatial structures, and professionalisation and mobility can also impact socio-spatial inequalities.

\textbf{Occupational structure}:\alignedmarginpar{Hamnett}professionalisation means high-income jobs are growing, and doesn't necessarily mean growth of low-paid jobs. There is an `upgrading' of the labour market, and better welfare states\alignedmarginpar{minimum wage} prevent extreme polarisation. Labour inequalities emerge because of market exclusion based on gender and ethnicity.

\textbf{Spatial structure}: statistics could exaggerate polarisation. Suburbanisation of the middle class could mean that middle-incomes are not disappearing but moving outside of the city. High-end housing demand drives super-gentrification\alignedmarginpar{Lees, 2003\\Brussels, Brooklyn}. Influence of pre-existing spatial forms and path dependencies. 

\textbf{Three-layer model}:\alignedmarginpar{Burgers and Musterd, 2000}for analysing inequality in cities: macro-level (global change, economic restructuring, increasing mobility of capital, people, commodities, information); micro-level (individual level, change in labour opportunities in a specific local context); medium-level (connects global and local, national institution differences, different urban trajectories)\alignedmarginpar{Charleroi/Detroit}

\textbf{Future}: income polarisation is expected to expand due to austerity, the flexibilisation of the labour market, migration labour, and political wealth.

\pagebreak\section{Urban Segregation: Patterns and Causes}

\textbf{Land-use model}:\alignedmarginpar{Burgess, 1925\\Chicago}an ideal type of 5 concentric circles shaped by the \textbf{bid rent theory}, whereby groups are able to pay different amount of rents (commerce/industry/residents). Density (and rent) decreases as one goes from the city centre towards suburbs. The model is of a growing city, in terms of population and built environment.

\textbf{Assumptions of land-use model}: assumes a cultural and social heterogeneity, a commercial and industrial economy, private ownership of property and economic competition for space, city expansion and population growth, equal mobility opportunities, CBD is the most valuable and the main centre for employment, attractiveness of districts is not based on terrain, no concentration of heavy industry, and not history survival of earlier land-use patterns in any district.

\textbf{Sector model}:\alignedmarginpar{Hoyt, 1939}a model for cities hit by socio-economic factors that slow population growth, in a society where cars play an increasingly important role. Sectors are organised around a core and grow outwards. Focus on social class rather than migrant groups.

\textbf{Multi-nuclei model}:\alignedmarginpar{Harris \& Ulman, 1945}a model where cities have a CBD, but also other strong areas with businesses and institutions.

\textbf{Alternative models}: the British city, the Chinese city, the African city (market zone, traditional CBD, colonial CBD), enclave urbanism (LA's skid row vs. gated suburbs), the post-socialist city.

\textbf{Provincialisation}: urban differentiation is characteristic of all cities. Urban form  is impacted by local features (topology, weather, socio-economic basis, migration patterns...) and local policies (transport systems, state interventions in housing, mobility restrictions, strategies to counter inequalities...). All land use models have birthmarks (time and place), and there is a need for provincialised (specific) theories about urban form and growth.

\textbf{Dimensions of (residential) segregation}:\alignedmarginpar{Massey \& Denton, 1988} the degree to which two or more groups live apart from each other in the urban environment. Dimensions are \textbf{evenness} (differential distribution of two social groups across space)\alignedmarginpar{index of dissimilarity}, \textbf{residential exposure} (degree of interaction opportunities between minority and majority groups in space), \textbf{concentration} (amount of physical space occupied by minority groups), \textbf{centralisation} (spatial distance from urban centre), \textbf{clustering} (extent to which minority-occupied areas adjoin one another in space). Scale matters!

\textbf{Causes of segregation}: different schools of thoughts on why different population groups occupy different parts of the city. \textbf{Quantitative spatial geography} uses ecological models of the city considered a natural area with homogeneous character, based on a pattern of expansion/competition/invasion/succession. \textbf{Radical-Marxist geography} uses flows of capital to understand where segregation fits. \textbf{Neo-Weberian geography} uses socio-economic constraints like financial, cognitive, political, social resources. \textbf{Behavioural geography} uses people's reasoning and preferences around living conditions and environments. \textbf{Post-modern geography} uses the meaning attached to home, and how it affects personal experiences.

\pagebreak\section{Neighbourhood Effects and Living with Diversity}

\textbf{Ideal of social mix}:\alignedmarginpar{Belgian cities, UK's HMR, USA, South Africa}popular amongst policy makers across the political spectrum. It supposes that where you live affects your life chances, such that residential segregation has a negative effect on the socio-economically disadvantaged, social mobility and cultural integration.

\textbf{Social mix feasibility}:\alignedmarginpar{Slater, Van Kempen \& Bolt} social mix policies don't resolve poverty, but displace people and move poverty elsewhere\alignedmarginpar{Brussels$\rightarrow$Charleroi}. Social mix that integrates different populations and helps rather than displaces is feasible, but hard to achieve in a market-dominant situation.

\textbf{Neighbourhood effects research}: bears birthmarks and needs to be \textbf{provincialised and contextualised}\alignedmarginpar{America vs. Europe}. Different researchers (ethno-cultural vs. socio-economic) have different approaches (qualitative vs. quantitative)

\textbf{Social network argument}: social capital is the connections and social networks that create reciprocity and trustworthiness between individuals.\alignedmarginpar{Strong \& weak ties} Living together creates bonding capital in socially homogeneous groups, and bridging capital between socially heterogeneous groups. BUT risks to disrupt existing bonding capital, and human extensibility\alignedmarginpar{Parallel lives}creates networks outside of neighbourhood

\textbf{Underclass argument}:\alignedmarginpar{Structuralists vs. Culturalists}poverty exists because of structural forces in a declining economic base, or because of a culture of poverty. Socialisation factors (peer groups, lack of role models) and institutional networks keep people in poverty. BUT are neighbourhoods really the cause?\alignedmarginpar{Uneven policing}Mobility and internet allow for socialisation outside the neighbourhood.

\textbf{Social cohesion argument}: living with natives creates opportunities for foreigners to integrate better. Using arguments of ethnic segregation and socio-economic mobility for social cohesion. BUT mobility means people can integrate outside neighbourhood, and local culture provides protective (arrival) spaces.

\textbf{Local services argument}: mixed neighbourhoods attract diverse shops and services. BUT differentiation creates differentiated demand that displaces specialised (ethnic) shops and services in arrival neighbourhoods, overshadows ethnic entrepreneurship which creates social mobility, and some may not find what they want.

\textbf{Political argument}:\alignedmarginpar{Environmental racism}mixed neighbourhoods will be higher on political agendas. BUT why don't politicians listen to low-income populations instead?

\textbf{Spatial mismatch argument}: disconnect between where people live (where poverty is concentrated) and low-skilled job opportunities. BUT is the problem social mix? Public transport gives people spatial mobility, and barriers like language prevent people from getting a job.

\textbf{Stigmatisation argument}: services and businesses hold stigmas and biases, and don't give as good a service or equal chances to poor residents.

\textbf{Conclusions}: social mix is not convincing. Instead of helping poor, ethnic minorities out of poverty, it displaces people and pushes gentrification. We need to ask: for whom is social mix? where and on what \textit{scale}? and what is the goal, and are there more effective alternatives?
