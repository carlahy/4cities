\subsection{Natalia Koch, \textit{Bordering on the modern: power, practice and exclusion in Astana}}\cite{koch2014bordering}

\textit{Keywords: modernism, emotional landscapes of control}

\begin{outline}
	\1 What were ordinary residents' and citizens' role in the capital-city making project of Astana?
	\1 In creating modernity, what or who were the city planners and residents trying to `exclude'
	\1 Astana is built on `tabula rasa'
	\1 Excluding the soviet past
		\2 Astana is built on top of an old soviet city, Tselinograd, which was renamed in 1998
		\2 To build Astana, a lot of run-down soviet era buildings and neighbourhoods (eg. wooden) were torn down, and the soviet idea of standardisation was no more. Argument was sanitisation, and prettification (buildings all looked the same, 5 story brown)
